# T2K-code
Code that I wrote while working for the Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) project. This code has a focus on the the Super-K far detector and is used to pre-process or post-process the data. Data analysis is done by using the ResNet CNN machine learning architecture to separate electrons and gamma-rays in the Super-K far detector.
